ssl/tls essentially creates tunnel between receiver/sender for secure data transfer

ssl prevents replay attacks(repeating a packet by copying a packet executing the same packet for request/response) by adding sequence number to packet, once the receiver/sender get this packet it logs the sequence number for particular request henceforth consequent reuqest from the same packet with same sequence number is discarded

CN in the certificate defines the commn dfomain name like *google.com-so this cert is valid for every subomain of google.cim
